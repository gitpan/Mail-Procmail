Change information for Mail::Procmail.

Version 1.04, released Apr 24, 2003

 * Procmail.pm: Small fixes w.r.t. pm_dupcheck. Thanks to Frederik Eaton.

 * Document procmail problems with big files.

Version 1.03, released May 8, 2002.

 * Make self-test more robust.

 * Provide (experimental) perl-Mail-Procmail.spec to build .rpm for
   RedHat 7.x. Note that this requires Mail::Internet and
   LockFile::Simple to be installed as RedHat packages as well. Spec
   files are provided to build these packages; you know where to get
   the sources...

 * Just some small typos.

Version 1.01, released January 24, 2001.

 * Explicitly seek to the end of the file when doing a mailbox

 * First 'official' release after several months of testing.

 * pm_pipe_to: Fix catching of broken pipe errors.

Version 0.91

 * Allow pm_gethdr to be called in array context, to deliver all
   occurrences of a header.
   Also, allow an optional 2nd argument, to select a specific occurrence.
 * Add pm_dupcheck to check for duplicate message IDs.
 * Correct call to gethdr in pm_deliver, in the case of maildir
   delivery. It should have been pm_gethdr.
